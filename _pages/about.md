Welcome! I am currently a visiting researcher in political science at the University of Amsterdam. In January 2019, I will take up a position as assistant professor in political science at [University College Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie/spire/).

Before this, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in Political Science at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, working on the Horizon2020 project [EUENGAGE](http://www.euengage.eu/). I was also a Max Weber Fellow at the European University Institute in Florence, and a research fellow at the University of Exeter. I received my PhD from [Stony Brook University](http://stonybrook.edu/polsci).  

My interests include comparative political behavior, political communication, EU politics, computational social science, and automated text analysis. I tweet under [hjms](http://www.twitter.com/hjms).
