Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in Political Science at [University College Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie/spire/).

Before this, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in Political Science at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, working on the Horizon2020 project [EUENGAGE](http://www.euengage.eu/). I was also a Max Weber Fellow at the European University Institute in Florence, and a research fellow at the University of Exeter. I received my PhD from [Stony Brook University](http://stonybrook.edu/polsci).  

 In my work, I analyze the rhetoric of politicians to learn about the politics that happens in between elections. Is their rhetoric driven by strategy, ideology or aspects of their personality? Do they shift blame to others when topics are sensitive with the public?  When do they use emotional appeals?
 
 More broadly, my interests include comparative political behavior, political communication, EU politics, computational social science, and text as data.

I tweet under [hjms](http://www.twitter.com/hjms).
