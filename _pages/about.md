I work as an Assistant Professor European Politics & Society at [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/let/onze-faculteit/organisatie/vakgebieden/europese-talen-en-culturen/chair-group-politics-and-society?lang=en).

Prior to this, I worked as an Assistant Professor in Political Science at [University College Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie/spire/). I also worked a postdoctoral fellow in Political Science at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; as a Max Weber Fellow at the European University Institute in Florence; and as a research fellow at the University of Exeter. I received my PhD from [Stony Brook University](http://stonybrook.edu/polsci).  

In my work, I use computational text analysis methods to study political rhetoric and political communication more broadly. My methodological interests concern issues related to multilingual text analysis and images as a means of political communication.
