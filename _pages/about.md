Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in Political Science at [University College Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie/spire/).

Prior to this, I was a postdoctoral fellow in Political Science at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. I was also a Max Weber Fellow at the European University Institute in Florence, and a research fellow at the University of Exeter. I received my PhD from [Stony Brook University](http://stonybrook.edu/polsci).  

In my work, I analyze the how politicians and political
parties communicate during times of crisis. What issues do they talk about? How do they
talk about those issues? And why? I also work on issues related to multilingual text analysis as well as images as a means of political communication. 
 
I am co-founder of the [Connected_Politics Lab](https://www.ucd.ie/connected_politics/) at UCD. I am also a member of the European research infrastructure project OPTED "Observatory for Political Texts in European Democracies"
