I work as an assistant professor European Politics & Society at [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/let/onze-faculteit/organisatie/vakgebieden/europese-talen-en-culturen/chair-group-politics-and-society?lang=en).

Prior to this, I worked as an assistant professor in Political Science at [University College Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie/spire/). I also worked a postdoctoral fellow in Political Science at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; as a Max Weber fellow at the European University Institute in Florence; and as a research fellow at the University of Exeter. I received my PhD from [Stony Brook University](http://stonybrook.edu/polsci).  

In my current work, I am particularly interested in the way that politicians construct authority claims in their discourse: _on what basis_, _how_ and  _with what purpose_ do they advocate for a particular course of action? My methodological interests concern issues related to multilingual text analysis and images as a means of political communication, and the use of new NLP methods for social science purposes.
