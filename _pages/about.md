Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in Political Science at [University College Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie/spire/).

Before this, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in Political Science at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, working on the Horizon2020 project [EUENGAGE](http://www.euengage.eu/). I was also a Max Weber Fellow at the European University Institute in Florence, and a research fellow at the University of Exeter. I received my PhD from [Stony Brook University](http://stonybrook.edu/polsci).  

 In my work, I analyze the rhetoric of political leaders to learn about the politics that happens in between elections. When do leaders use emotional appeals and are they succesful with the public? Is their rhetoric driven by strategy or personality? How do leaders use their public speeches to try out new policy ideas and when is this successful? Do they shift blame to others when policies hurt the public? 
 
 More broadly, my interests include comparative political behavior, political communication, EU politics, computational social science, and text as data.
