Welcome! My name is Martijn Schoonvelde and I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in Political Science at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, working on the Horizon2020 project [EUENGAGE](http://www.euengage.eu/). 

Before this, I was a Max Weber Fellow at the European University Institute in Florence, and at the University of Exeter. I received my PhD from [Stony Brook University](http://stonybrook.edu/polsci).  

My interests include comparative political behavior, EU politics and automated text analysis. I tweet under [hjms](http://www.twitter.com/hjms).

Best,

Martijn Schoonvelde
