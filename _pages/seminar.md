I am a co-founder of the [Connected\_Politics Lab](https://www.ucd.ie/connected_politics/),  an interdisciplinary hub for researchers using computational methods to study politics. The lab is hosted by the [School of Politics and International Relations (SPIRe)](https://www.ucd.ie/spire/) at UCD.

The Connected\_Politics Lab is an interdisciplinary hub for researchers using computational methods to study politics and society. Faculty affiliated with the Connected\_Politics Lab teach in the new MSc Programme in [Politics and Data Science](https://sisweb.ucd.ie/usis/!W_HU_MENU.P_PUBLISH?p_tag=PROG&MAJR=W473).

Bi-monthly Connected\_Politics Lab meetings are scheduled for Wednesdays 2:00 - 3:00 PM throughout teaching terms. During these meetings, we welcome guest speakers, discuss new research ideas, and bring together a diverse group of scholars with an interest in computational social and political science.
