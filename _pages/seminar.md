**Program of the 7th Mind, Text, and Mining seminar:** 

_Q&A (via Skype) with James W. Pennebaker (University of Texas Austin) after which we will have a round table discussion._

  * **About the speaker:** Professor James Pennebaker is Centennial Liberal Arts Professor of Psychology at the University of Texas at Austin. He is a key figure in the study of psychology using text both through his wide-ranging research and through development of the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) text analysis program, which is being used by many researchers within the social sciences and in industry.

  * **Date and time:** October 18, 2018, 3-5PM (we will start at 3 PM sharp!)

  * **Location**: NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide studies (Herengracht 380 1016 CJ Amsterdam)

**About the seminar:** _In various academic fields texts are analysed for indicators of speaker personality, or speaker emotions like disgust, anger, and happiness: concepts which have been shown to drive political behavior or to represent opinions, attitudes or emotionality in relation to certain topics. Quantitative analysis of these psychological constructs in the study of historical, social, and political phenomena is burgeoning._

_To learn more about these developments, we have formed a multidisciplinary group of interested and active researchers in the Netherlands by means of a regularly occurring seminar in which best practices in applied work, new methodologies, and substantive new findings are exchanged and discussed. We aim for a group of committed members who intend to participate on a regular basis._
