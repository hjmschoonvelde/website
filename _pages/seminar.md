I am a co-founder of the [Connected\_Politics Lab](https://www.ucd.ie/connected_politics/),  an interdisciplinary hub for researchers using computational methods to study politics. The lab is hosted by the [School of Politics and International Relations (SPIRe)](https://www.ucd.ie/spire/) at UCD.

The Connected\_Politics Lab is a place where students and researchers can apply computational approaches to topics such as the rise of populism, political ideology, electoral campaigning, and media personalisation, as well as regime transitions,  legislative politics, policy agendas, discourse, protest behaviour, and political violence.

Bi-monthly Connected\_Politics Lab meetings are scheduled for Wednesdays 2:00 - 3:00 PM throughout teaching terms. During these meetings, we welcome guest speakers, discuss new research ideas, and bring together a diverse group of scholars with an interest in computational social and political science.
