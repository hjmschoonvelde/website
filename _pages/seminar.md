*Mind, Text and Mining seminar VI*
 
 We are excited to announce Mind, Text and Mining Seminar VI which will feature [David Graus](http://graus.co/). 
 
 David, who works as a Data Scientist at the FD Media Group, will give a talk titled *Financial News Mining*:

* Where: Main Building, Vrije Universiteit, HG-1D22 Forum 5
* When: 27 May 2018
* What time: 3-5PM
* Registration: if you want to participate, please send an email to Martijn Schoonvelde (h.j.m.schoonvelde[at]vu.nl).
* Abstract of the talk:
 
*The FD Mediagroep collects, analyses and filters valuable and relevant information, 24/7, for an influential group of professionals, business executives and high net worth individuals. 
Company.info (part of FDMG) provides complete, reliable, up-to-date company information and business news about no less than 2.7 million companies and other legal entities in the Netherlands. 
For Company.info we continuously monitor and crawl hundreds of (online) news sources, resulting in a large archive of (Dutch) business-related news, spanning hundreds of thousands of articles. 
These articles are automatically enriched, by linking the profiles of companies that are mentioned in the articles using a custom-built entity linking framework, and applying sentiment analysis. 
In this talk, I will briefly explain the applied text analysis methods and entity linking task, I will provide some insights into how we built our custom entity linking framework, and show some example applications of applying entity linking and information extraction in news articles.*

Kind regards,

 *Background of the seminar*

In various academic fields texts are analysed for indicators of speaker personality, or speaker emotions like disgust, anger, and happiness: concepts which have been shown to drive political behaviour or to represent opinions, attitudes or emotionality in relation to certain topics. Quantitative analysis or ‘mining’ of these psychological constructs in the study of historical, social, and political phenomena is burgeoning.

To learn more about these developments, we have formed a multidisciplinary group of interested and active researchers in the Netherlands by means of a regularly occurring seminar in which best practices in applied work, new methodologies, and substantive new findings are exchanged and discussed. We aim for a group of committed members who intend to participate on a regular basis.
