*Mind, Text and Mining seminar*

In various academic fields texts are analysed for indicators of speaker personality, or speaker emotions like disgust, anger, and happiness: concepts which have been shown to drive political behaviour or to represent opinions, attitudes or emotionality in relation to certain topics. Quantitative analysis or ‘mining’ of these psychological constructs in the study of historical, social, and political phenomena is burgeoning.

To learn more about these developments, we are forming a multidisciplinary group of interested and active researchers in the Netherlands by means of a regularly occurring seminar in which best practices in applied work, new methodologies, and substantive new findings are exchanged and discussed. We aim for a group of committed members who intend to participate on a regular basis.

Program of the fourth *Mind, Text, and Mining seminar*:

* Welcome by dr. Martijn Schoonvelde (Vrije Universiteit)
* Presentation by dr. Mark Dechesne (Leiden University): "Episode Analysis: Applying factor analyses to identify episodes in political and historical texts"
* Roundtable discussion on clustering techniques in biographical and political texts


Date and time: **December 14th | 3-5PM** (we will start at 3 PM sharp!)
Location: **The Hague, at Leiden University – Faculty of Governance and Global Affairs, Schouwburgstraat 2, 2511 VA, The Hague, Room: B.04.02.**

The number of participants is limited. If you want to participate, please send an email to Martijn Schoonvelde (h.j.m.schoonvelde[at]vu.nl).
