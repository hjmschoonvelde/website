*EUSpeech*

As part of my work for EUENGAGE I helped develop the EUSpeech dataset. EUSpeech is a dataset of 18,403 speeches from EU leaders (i.e., heads of government in 10 member states, EU commissioners, party leaders in the European Parliament, and ECB and IMF leaders) from 2007 to 2015. These speeches vary in sentiment, topics and ideology, allowing for fine-grained, over-time comparison of representation in the EU. EUSpeech can be found [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/euspeech).
