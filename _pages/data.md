*EUSpeech v2.0*

As part of my work for EUENGAGE I helped develop the EUSpeech dataset, which was recently updated to version 2. EUSpeech v2.0 is a dataset of 11,466 speeches from heads of government from 14  different European countries (2007--2019). These speeches vary in sentiment, topics and ideology, allowing for fine-grained, over-time comparison of representation in the EU. EUSpeech v2.0 can be found [here](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a4uyw/).
